John and his family went on a hoiay and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were 124, 48 and 258 dollars respectively. To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the billll is less than 50 dollars, 15% when the bill is between 50 dollars and 200 dollars and 10% if the bill is more than 200 dollars.
